# Commit Messages

1. Well written commit messages offer the thought process at the time of writing and the reason as to why changes were made. This allows any programmer (including future you) to have a deeper understanding behind what the code is doing and why.
2. It's preferred to keep the subject lines at 50 characters or less. The body can have up to 72 characters per line.
