# Links and Images

1. The anchor element, `<a>`, is used to create a link.
2. An attribute is a parameter or extra information that affects the element it is used on. For example, the `<a>` element requires the `href` attribute to specify where the link leads to.
3. Refer to previous answer.
4. In using the `target` attribute, without specifying `noopener` and `noreferrer`, the website that the element leads to will be visible and can be affected by the target page. Those attributes ensure the target page is unable to find or affect the leading pages.
5. An absolute link makes use of an absolute path which is the most specific address to a resource. For example, `"https://www.google.com"` or `"C:\Users\User\example.html"`. A relative path leads to a resource **relative** to the current page. For example, `"./images/img.jpg"` tells the browser to look in the current directory, then the "images" directory for "img.jpg".
6. The `<img>` element is used to display an image.
7. Images are required to have both the `src` and `alt` attributes.
8. Access parent directories with `../`.
9. JPG, PNG, GIF and SVG
