## Command Line Basics

### Knowledge Check

1. The command line is a means of interacting with the computer via a terminal using commands instead of a GUI (graphical user interface)
2. On some Linux distros, you can use `Ctrl+Alt+T`. On others simply by clicking or searching for it
3. By using the `cd` or "change directory" command followed by the directory's relative or absolute path
4. To the home directory. In this case: `/home/<user>`.
5. Back up one level in the file system tree or simply to the previous directory
6. By using the `pwd` or "print working directory" command.
7. By using the `ls` or "list directory contents" command followed by the relative or absolute path of the directory.
8. By using the `mkdir` or "make directory" command followed by the name you want to use for the new directory.
9. By using the `touch` command to create an empty file. (Using the `nano` text editor can also create files but the files must be explicitly saved or written)
10. By using the `rm` or "remove" command followed by the name of the file. For directories, you must use the `-d` flag/option.
11. By using the `mv` or "move" command following by two parameters: the current name and the new name of the file or directory.
