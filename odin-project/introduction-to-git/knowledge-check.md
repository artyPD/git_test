## Introduction to Git

### Knowledge Check

1. Git is a distributed version control system (D-VCS).
2. A text editor saves the entire document into a single file. Git saves the file, folders and keeps a historical record of each save. Allowing the ability to revert back to previous states of an entire project or specific files.
3. Git works at a local level.
4. Github works at the remote level.
5. Git is useful for a developer to track changes over time and be able to revert to any previous state of the project or file. This allows the developer to continue making changes without affecting the rest of the project and in fear of losing any data.
6. Git makes it significantly easier for developers to collaborate on a project together. Any changes made are local first and allow each developer to make their own changes without affecting the work of anyone else. Due to each developer having a local copy of the repository. There are multiple copies of the repository making it more redundant the more people that work on the project.
