## HTML Boilerplate

1. The purpose of the doctype declaration is to declare the version of HTML that this document will be using to render the content.
2. The `html` element is the root element where every other element will be found within.
3. The `head` element contains meta data on the site like the character set to allow proper rendering of special characters and the `title` element to specify the text displayed on the browser's tab.
4. The `body` element contains all the content to be rendered and seen by the user.
